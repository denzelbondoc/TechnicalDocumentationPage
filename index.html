        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
      </p>

      <p>
         HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.

      <ul>
        <li>
         <b>Elements and Tags:</b> HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.</li>
        <li>
         <b>HTML page structure:</b> The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.</li>

    <article>
      <p>
        In this article, we will go through all the basic stuff of HTML coding. There are various tags that we must consider and include while starting to code in HTML. These tags help in the organization and basic formatting of elements in our script or web pages. These step by step procedures will guide you through the process of writing HTML.</p>

      <p>Basic HTML Document: Below mentioned are the basic HTML tags which divide the whole document into various parts like head, body etc.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Every HTML document begins with a HTML document tag. Although this is not mandatory but it is a good convention to start the document with this below-mentioned tag. </li><code>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</code>
      
      <li><b>&lthtml&gt:</b> Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic HTML tags. It begins with &lthtml> and ends with &lt/html> tag.</li>
<li><b>&lthead>:</b> The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or documents like the title of the page and other miscellaneous information. This information is enclosed within the head tag which opens with &lthead> and ends with &lt/head>.</li>
      <li><b>&lttitle>:</b> We can mention the title of a web page using the &lttitle> tag. This is header information and hence is mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with &lttitle> and ends with &lt/title>.</li>
      <li><b>&ltbody>:</b> Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with &ltbody> and ends with &lt/body>. Every content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be it writings or images or audios or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may insert mentioned contents into our web pages.</li>
    </ul>
